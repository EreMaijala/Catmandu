The system is based on an emerging multi-core microprocessor architecture (Cell Broadband Engine, Cell BE) known to outperform any available general purpose or DSP processor in the domain of real-time advanced video processing solutions. We start from a recent wavelet domain blur estimation algorithm which uses histograms of a local regularity measure called average cone ratio (ACR). This approach has shown a very good potential for assessing the level of blur in the image yet some important aspects remain to be addressed in order for the method to become a practically working one. Some of these aspects are explored in our work. Furthermore, we develop an efficient real-time implementation of the novelty metric and integrate it into a system that captures live video. The proposed system estimates blur extent and renders the results to the remote user in real-time.","Technology and Engineering","real-time ; Cell BE ; image quality ; blur estimation ; multi-core ; wavelets","Platisa, Ljiljana (802000272646@TW07) ; Pizurica, Aleksandra (801001580450@TW07) ; Philips, Wilfried (801000739176@TW07)","TW07","PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)","Proc.

Wood of these trees has been evaluated for Kraft pulping. The results show that lignin is more easily extracted from wood of the CAD-downregulated trees, whereas wood from COMT-downregulated trees is less suitable for Kraft pulping. Detailed NMR analyses of lignin from COMT-downregulated poplars reveal the presence of benzodioxane structures, which are derived from coupling of 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol with the lignin polymer, showing that monolignols other than p-coumaryl, coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol can be incorporated into lignin. Analysis of poplar downregulated for CCoAOMT shows that CCoAOMT is involved in the synthesis of both syringyl and guaiacyl units, and that sinapic is probably not an important precursor for syringyl lignin synthesis.","Biology and Life Sciences","PATHWAYS ; COMT ; METHYLATION ; CAD ; CINNAMYL ALCOHOL-DEHYDROGENASE ; XYLEM ; CCoAOMT ; O-METHYLTRANSFERASE ACTIVITY ; lignin ; poplar ; Kraft pulping","Boerjan, Wout (801000651674@WE09) ; Meyermans, Hugo (801000951768@onbekend) ; Chen, Cuiying (801001303392@WE14) ; Baucher, Marie (801000900036@onbekend) ; Van Doorsselaere, Jan (801000905490@onbekend) ; Morreel, Kris (801001178407@WE09) ; Messens, Eric (801000164048@WE09)","WE09","Progress in Biotechnology","Progr.

In this article, we argue that conventional participation research has focused too one-sidedly on quantitatively expanding the range of types of activities, while the complex dimensionality is not reflected in the measures used. We formulate a methodological critique by using the metaphor of the 'black box', which refers to the implicit and unquestioned assumption that distinct types of activities and associations represent homogeneous and consistent realities that do not warrant further analytical decomposition. Surveys of participation allocate individuals to different 'participation boxes' by means of a binary logic, leaving a void of what is actually happening inside the boxes. To conclude, we reflect upon the fundamental dilemmas the black box of participation raises for theory and research, and offer conceptual and methodological keys to unlock the participation box.","Social Sciences","survey research ; triangulation ; methodological critique ; Participation ; conceptual developments","Hustinx, Lesley (802000853939@PS04)","PS04","JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY","","","5","3","","","","","","","","","","","original","","","published","eng","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/17448680903351693","Y","open access at 2010-07-03","","","2011-02-02 09:47:43","2011-02-11 00:30:28","NOUGENT","","","nrobbere"

Methods and Results: Both cell number and colony volume of Salmonella Typhimurium in gelatin were monitored during the exponential and the stationary phase with varying pH and water activity, by plate counts and microscopic image analysis respectively. The exponential growth rates of cell numbers and colony volumes were correlated. The exponential growth rate of cell numbers was estimated based on this correlation and a secondary model that describes the effect of pH and water activity on the growth rate of the colony volumes. During the stationary phase, the cell number was constant, while colony volume increased, thus indicating the formation of a dead fraction. Models were developed to describe the living and dead population. Conclusions: By comparing colony volumes and cell numbers, the formation of dead fraction can be noticed from the beginning of the stationary phase, which indicates that the stationary phase is a dynamic - including both cell death and cell growth - rather than a static phase. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study was the first to investigate the proportion of living and dead bacteria within a stationary colony quantitatively.","Biology and Life Sciences","MICROSTRUCTURE ; PH ; WATER ACTIVITY ; TEMPERATURE ; structured media ; population heterogeneity ; bacterial colony ; ESCHERICHIA-COLI ; GROWTH ; BACTERIAL COLONIES","Devlieghere, Frank (801000909433@LA07)","LA07","LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY","Lett.

Maar recent duiken nieuwe vormen van vrijwilligerswerk op: in het bedrijfsleven, aan de overheid (OCMW’s, arbeidsmarktbeleid, gezondheidssector), in onderwijsinstellingen en andere instituten. Bovendien staan niet alle vrijwilligersorganisaties open voor alle doelgroepen. Het vrijwilligersbestand in Vlaanderen heeft er ongetwijfeld baat bij als we werk maken van de inzet van jongeren (via maatschappelijke stages), van ouderen (via een gericht beleid) en van kansengroepen (via verschillende ondersteunende maatregelen, een uitgestippeld arbeidsmarktbeleid, initiatieven vanuit OCMW’s). Creëert de driehoeksverhouding tussen vrijwilligerswerk, activering en arbeidsmarkt vrijwilligers tegen wil en dank? Of hebben Chinese vrijwilligers alleen maar te winnen bij het activeringsdiscours? In deze publicatie worden de ontwikkelingen van ‘geleid’ vrijwilligerswerk bekeken vanuit verschillende invalshoeken: maatschappelijk, historisch, wetenschappelijk. Het resultaat is een uniek boek dat focust op het vrijwilligerswerk in volle ontwikkeling.","Social Sciences","","Hustinx, Lesley (802000853939@PS04)","PS04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","published","dut","http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-1123142","Y","ugent","","","2011-02-03 11:24:02","2011-02-28 14:29:07","UGENT","","","nrobbere"

Examples can be found in advanced prostheses, neurofarmaceuticals, genetic technologies and other fields. The ethical value of this enhancement medicine is being debated fiercly. Often the debate takes the form of a so-called ‘bio-conservative’ stance as opposed to a ‘transhumanist’ position. Transhumanists argue for the fundamental right to ‘morphological freedom’: every individual has, in principle, the right to determine for himself the shape and functions of his own body and every intrusion on this fundamental right – the blanket prohibition on any kind of enhancement medicine being the prime example hereof – has to be accompanied by strong ethical or societal arguments. Bioconservatives often argue precisely for such a general and universal prohibition, often based on intrinsic ethical arguments concerning the goodness of human nature and the unacceptability to freely alter this nature, even if such a choice is based on the sincere personal wish of an informed and socially responsible individual. I focus on these intrinsic arguments concerning the goodness of enhancement. I analyse the bioconservative arguments to conclude that they are incoherent and sometimes even internally inconsistent. Blindness for the responsibility of non-intervention plays a key role here. Furthermore I argue that the fundamental right to morphological freedom should logically be protected in any liberal democratic ethical theory. None the less, as the biological mold of human nature becomes a field of our own cultural agency, our natural passions dissolve as a source of spontaneous motivation. Thus the reality of ever-deepening morphological freedom confronts us with a new existential shock which has not yet been brought into clear focus and which poses a profound challenge for much of modern day discourse on motivation and choice.","Philosophy and Religion","Verbeterkunde Enhancement medicine Transhumanisme Transhumanism Eugenetica Eugenics Biotechnologie Biotechnology Bio-ethiek Bioethics Vrijheid Zelfbeschikkingsrecht","Bonte, Pieter (002002311887@LW01)","LW01","Ethiek & Maatschappij","","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","original","","","published","dut","http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-1048706","Y","open access","","","2010-10-04 11:28:28","2011-02-10 14:20:48","NOUGENT","","","pbonte"

This phase I/II partially blinded, randomized, dose-ranging study assessed the safety and immunogenicity of a novel human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine candidate consisting of a recombinant fusion protein (F4) containing 4 HIV-1 clade B antigens (Gag p24, Pol reverse transcriptase, Nef, and Gag p17) adjuvanted with AS01 in HIV-seronegative volunteers. Methods. Two doses of the recombinant F4 protein (10, 30, or 90 μg/dose), adjuvanted with AS01 or reconstituted with water for injection, were administered 1 month apart to 180 healthy volunteers aged 18-40 years. F4-specific CD4(+) T cell responses were measured using intracellular cytokine staining after in vitro stimulation by overlapping peptide pools covering the 4 individual antigens. Results. Reactogenicity was higher during the 7-day period after each vaccine dose in the adjuvanted than in the nonadjuvanted groups. In the adjuvanted groups, the overall immune response rate was high after the second vaccine dose, with highest responder rates seen in the 10-μg F4/AS01 group (100% to 3 HIV-1 antigens and 80% to all 4 HIV-1 antigens). High and long-lasting CD4(+) T cell frequencies were observed (up to a median value of 1.2% F4-specific CD4(+) T cells at day 44), with strongest responses directed against reverse transcriptase. Antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells exhibited a polyfunctional phenotype, expressing at least CD40 ligand and interleukin 2, often in combination with tumor necrosis factor α and/or interferon γ. Vaccine-induced CD4(+) T cell responses were broadly cross-reactive to all 4 antigens derived from HIV-1 clades A and C. Conclusions. These results support further clinical investigation of this HIV-1 vaccine candidate both in a prophylactic setting (alone, in conjunction with an envelope-based antigen or in combination with other vaccine approaches in a heterologous prime-boost regimen) and as a potentially disease-modifying therapeutic vaccine in HIV-1-infected subjects.","Medicine and Health Sciences","vaccine ; HIV","Van Braeckel, Eva (802000044391@CA80) ; Clement, Frédéric (801001012493@GE06) ; Leroux-Roels, Geert (801000485057@GE06)","GE06","CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES","Clin.

On the Galapagos Archipelago. seven very closely related morpho-species of the wolf spiders genus Hogna are distinguishable based on small somatic and genital differences. Based on habitat preference, these species can broadly be categorized into (i) "high elevation species" occurring on the volcanic highlands, (ii) three "coastal dry" species occurring in dune habitats along the coast, and (iii) one generalist species which is chiefly found in wet coastal habitats such as salt marshes but also in wet habitats at higher altitudes. To determine the degree of reproductive isolation among these morpho-species. we investigated gene flow among populations and species based on nine allozyme loci. Genetic analysis by means of genetic distance estimates and cluster agglomerative analyses confirmed the status of the defined morpho-species. Allele frequencies were highly similar among populations within a species but differed profoundly among species. Genetic differentiation within the generalist species was generally very low. There were no constant differences between high elevation and coastal populations for this species. Neutral genetic divergence between species appeared to correspond more to geographic distribution rather than to a clear separation of the two different ecological groups within an island. This suggests that a parallel parapatric divergence between high elevation and coastal dry species may have taken place on the oldest islands of San Cristobal and Santa Cruz.","","TORTOISES ; ISLANDS ; FINCHES ; Wolf spiders ; ecological speciation ; HISTORY ; WEEVILS ; POPULATIONS ; speciation ; COLONIZATION ; island biogeography ; DIVERSIFICATION ; ADAPTIVE RADIATION","Hendrickx, Frederik (801001213668@WE11) ; Maelfait, Jean-Pierre (801000338648@WE11)","WE11","JOURNAL OF ARACHNOLOGY","J.

Faculty of Sciences","Ghent, Belgium","2010. Ghent University. Faculty of Sciences.","XXIV, 334","","","","","","","","D1","2010","","Pseudodesmin A, a member of the viscosin group, is a cyclic lipodepsipeptide (CLP) consisting out of an oligopeptide that is cyclised through a lactone bond between its C-terminal carboxyl group and the hydroxyl group of a threonine side chain and a 3-hydroxydecanoic acid moiety bonded to the N-terminal end of the peptide. It is found to self-assemble in apolar organic solvents, which is reminiscent of its expected ability of forming ion pores in cellular membranes. The goal of this dissertation is to investigate the self-assembly in organic solvents and the structure of the assemblies formed mainly by translational diffusion and heteronuclear relaxation NMR measurements. After covering some theory and background concerning diffusion, translational diffusion NMR, NMR relaxation, and CLPs, the elucidation of the pseudodesmin A conformation – by both X-ray diffraction and NMR – will be discussed. Next, the self-assembly is studied by translational diffusion measurements at different concentrations in chloroform and acetonitrile/chloroform mixtures. Using these results, a model is proposed for the supramolecular assembly that explains the selective self-assembly in non-polar environment, the limitless nature of the assembly and the biological function of the ion pore. This model, confirmed by the detection of intermolecular rOe contacts, encompasses a side by side aggregation of the amphipathic monomer alpha-helical units followed by a stacking of these aggregates – along a direction closely parallel to the alpha-helix – to cylindrically shaped structures. Heteronuclear 13C-alpha relaxation is then used to gain more insight in the organisation of the supramolecular structure and to confirm some aspects of the proposed model. The dependence of the 13C-alpha R1 and R2 relaxation rate constants on the 13C-1H bond vector orientation within a molecular structure is used to obtain information concerning the rotational diffusion properties of the assembly and the orientation of the monomer within the supramolecular assembly. This is used to acquire the shape and average dimensions of the supramolecular assembly, which confirm the model of cylindrical assemblies that grow in only one dimension, nearly parallel with the helix structure. Finally, a theoretical simulation is performed to assess the impact of the self-association equilibria on the relaxation rate constants.","Chemistry","pseudodesmin ; viscosin group ; self-assembly ; cyclic lipodepsipeptide ; relaxation ; NMR spectroscopy ; diffusion ; WLIP ; ion channel","Sinnaeve, Davy (801002020586@WE07)","WE07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2010-05-20 16:00","Gent : Campus Sterre (S4, auditorium A)","","","monograph","","eng","http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-968417","Y","private at 2012-01-01","","","2010-06-02 15:01:30","2011-01-10 15:33:26","UGENT","","copyrighted material (two published articles in appendices) was left out of pdf version","dsinnaev"
